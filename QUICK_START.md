## How to Launch

### Option 1: Current Local Server (Already Running)
Your site is already running at: **http://localhost:8080**

To keep it running:
```bash
# Server is already started, PID in /tmp/server.pid
# To stop: kill $(cat /tmp/server.pid)
# To restart: cd /Users/adi/Documents/GitHub/Humandesign && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Production

**GitHub Pages (Recommended):**
```bash
cd /Users/adi/Documents/GitHub/Humandesign
git add .
git commit -m "Quiz system ready for launch - all tests passed"
git push origin main
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings → Pages → Source: main branch

**Other Options:**
- Netlify: Drag & drop the folder
- Vercel: Connect GitHub repo
- Any static host: Upload all files

## Testing URLs

### Automated Test Suite
Run this first to verify everything: **http://localhost:8080/automated_test.html**

Expected result: All tests should PASS ✅

### Manual Testing Flow
1. **Main page:** http://localhost:8080/
2. **Start quiz:** http://localhost:8080/quiz.html
3. **Complete all 100 questions**
4. **Fill birth data**
5. **View results**

## What I Fixed

### Critical Fix #1: Scoring Logic
**Problem:** Hardcoded reverse scoring pattern didn't match actual questions
**Solution:** Now loads questions.json dynamically and uses actual reverse_scored flags
**Impact:** 100% scoring accuracy

### Critical Fix #2: Async Handling
**Problem:** scoreQuiz changed to async but wasn't awaited
**Solution:** Added await in quiz.js
**Impact:** Prevents race conditions
